# Alignment

```{seealso}
See the Xarray tutorial on [Alignment](https://tutorial.xarray.dev/fundamentals/02.3_aligning_data_objects.html#alignment-putting-data-on-the-same-grid).
```

Simple forms of alignment are supported.

Consider this non-overlapping pair of tiles with two transform:

```{code-cell}
transforms = [
    "-50.0 5 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.25",
    "-40.0 5 0.0 0.0 0.0 -0.25",
]
```

import pyproj
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import rasterix

dsets = [
    (i+1) * xr.Dataset(
        {"foo": (("y", "x"), np.ones((4, 2)), {"grid_mapping": "spatial_ref"})},
        coords={
            "spatial_ref": (
                (),
                0,
                pyproj.CRS.from_epsg(4326).to_cf() | {"GeoTransform": transform},
            )
        },
    )
    for i, transform in enumerate(transforms)
]
datasets = list(map(rasterix.assign_index, dsets))
datasets[0]
```

```{code-cell}
datasets[1]
```

## `join="outer"`

For outer joins, we reindex so that both datasets are expanded to the _union_ of the input bounding boxes:

```{code-cell}
outer = xr.align(*datasets, join="outer")
outer[0]
```

```{code-cell}
outer[1]
```

## `join="inner"`

For outer joins, we reindex so that both datasets are restricted to the _intersection_ of the input bounding boxes:

There is no overlap in `x` for this set of non-overlapping tiles

```{code-cell}
inner = xr.align(*datasets, join="inner")
inner[0]
```

## `join="exact"`

For exact joins, we compare transforms. Since these are not identical, we see an {py:class}`AlignmentError`.
